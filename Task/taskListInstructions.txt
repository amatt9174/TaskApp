Create a production ready (tests not required) Whiteboard application.  The purpose
of this application will be to create and track high-level tasks given to users.

Requirements:

- No authentication/authorization required.  If you can access the site, you
  can do everything.
- Users to be stored in file on disk with the name "users.data".  Data in
  this file can be formatted/read however you would like.
- Tasks to be stored in file on disk with the name "tasks.data".  Data in
  this file can be formatted/read however you would like.
- At a minimum, the task object should contain the following properties (don't get carried away adding a lot more - if any):
  -- Id, Title, CreatedOn, Comments, AssignedTo, Status, StatusChangedOn
- Two views should be created
  -- One to show the list of tasks not closed or completed => simple table view (https://praxie.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Task-List-Thumbnail-Template.png)
  -- One to let user edit task
- Write in way that updating from flat files on disk to something like database
  would require little effort.  You do not need to implement the database CRUD.
